## DEGREE (Deep Graph Embedding for Structure Learning)

These scripts are implementations of DEGREE model in our manuscript entitled "Deep Graph Embedding for Structure Learning in E-commerce networks". Here is the architecture of DEGREE. With DEGREE, our goal is to learn valuable network representations, as well as preserve both inter-group interactions and intra-group structures in e-commerce networks.
